README for TSM - Twitter Subgraph Manipulator by Deen Freelon <dfreelon@gmail.com>

In short, TSM is a Python module that contains a few functions for analyzing Twitter and Twitter-like (i.e. very sparse, directed) network data. I wrote it for my own research purposes but thought someone out there might find it useful.

Here are some of the things TSM can do:
* Extract retweets and @-mentions into edgelist format for network analysis and visualization
* Partition networks into communities, isolate the N largest communities, and identify the most-connected users in each community
* Measure the insularity of network communities (using EI indices) to determine the extent to which each looks like an echo chamber
* Measure the overlap between network communities to determine which ones interact more and less often
* Get the top retweets in a Twitter dataset and rank them by N of retweets and by community
* Track Twitter (or other) communities over time: compute similarity scores (weighted or unweighted Jaccard coefficients) for partitioned network communities based on the same Twitter keyword search at two different time slices
* Discover which nodes bridge which communities
* Find the most-used hashtags in each community

Here are TSM's requirements:
* Python 3.x (needed for Unicode support)
* NetworkX (available at http://networkx.github.io/)
* community3.py, a version of Thomas Aynaud's Python implementation of the Louvain method of network community detection modified to work with Python 3.x. You can download it from my Github page: https://github.com/dfreelon. The original 2.x-compatible version is available here: http://perso.crans.org/aynaud/communities/   
* tsm.py, the TSM Python module

See tsm.py for a full description of TSM's functions and how to use them. The module should work as long as NetworkX is installed and community3.py and tsm.py are placed in the same directory. tsm_test2.py contains code examples, but requires raw Twitter data to function properly (details in the file itself).

I gratefully acknowledge funding support from the US Institute of Peace in creating this module.
